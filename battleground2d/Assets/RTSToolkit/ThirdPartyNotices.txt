Some of RTS Toolkit parts uses 3rd party tools and this file will highlight what is being used as well as links to relevant projects:

1. Unity Standard Assets (https://docs.unity3d.com/560/Documentation/Manual/HOWTO-InstallStandardAssets.html) is included in the project and used in some parts of RTS Toolkit. This includes some particle systems, water, night time greying post processing effect, etc. Standard assets are cleaned up to remove unused assets and adopted to RTS Toolkit needs.

2. Parts of Unity NavMeshComponents (https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/NavMeshComponents , MIT License) are included in the project and used for runtime NavMesh generation. NavMeshComponents code has been slightly simplified to scan only terrains and exclude meshes. This provides faster NavMesh building.

3. KDTree class (http://forum.unity3d.com/threads/29923-Point-nearest-neighbour-search-class) is used across RTS Toolkit for accelerating search of nearest neighbours. The code has been adopted to RTS Toolkit needs.

4. Camera Marquee tutorial (http://paulbutera.wordpress.com/2013/04/04/unity­rts­tutorial­part­1­marquee­selection­of­units/) was adopted to implement rectangular units selection. The code was adopted to RTS Toolkit needs.

5. Terrain generation classes were adopted from procedural terrain generation tutorial: http://code-phi.com/infinite-terrain-generation-in-unity-3d/ . This code has been heavily reworked for RTS Toolkit needs.

6. Humanoid model mesh has been created with MakeHuman (http://www.makehumancommunity.org/) and modelled with Blender (https://www.blender.org/), i.e. added weapons, armour, UV maps and animations.

7. Some CC0 textures for model UV maps has been used from http://opengameart.org/ (UV maps are baked in Blender and original textures are not included in RTS Toolkit).

8. RTS Toolkit includes extension plugin for A* Pathfinding Project (http://arongranberg.com/astar/). No files from A* Pathfinding Project are included in RTS Toolkit.
